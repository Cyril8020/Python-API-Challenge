In this python challenge, we were tasked with creating a script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities from various different distances from the equator. 
This will allow use to get enough data in order to find some trends in the different climates that are around the equator. 

We are then taksed with planning vacations with ideal temperatures that we want and finding a hostel near our ideal weather.
